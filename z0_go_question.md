#### go 版本更新 

brew update
brew install go

#### cannot find package "fmt" in any of:
unset GOROOT

#### flag provided but not defined: -goversion

一个是版本原因, 一个是vscode也要修改配置gopath, 坑爹

>Thank you, I was able to solve this by running brew uninstall --force go and then downloading the latest installer. Anyone who reads this and wants to use brew you could probably just do brew install go after the forced uninstall. I had to restart my terminal and Gogland after doing this.

#### vscode not jump define

```
        "go.useLanguageServer": true,
        "go.docsTool": "gogetdoc",
```

#### vscode could not launch process: exec: "lldb-server": executable file not found in $PATH

```
        xcode-select --install
```


#### vscode jump slow
安装https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver
源码安装 需要 go install
```
  "go.useLanguageServer": true,
```

#### vscode goto Definition, Hover, Signature Help do not work for Dot imported functions 

go 1.92 貌似不行, 已提交vscode issue


#### vscode output window hide go
~/.vscode/扩展包/package.json 找到显示的
```
    "showOutput": "never"
```

set | smembers key, sadd key value
zset | zrange key 0 10 withscores, zadd key value
hash | hgetall key | hset key value
